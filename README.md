# Album-Visualizer-Project-1

Elevator Pitch: This website allows a user to search an artist name, and it will display some information about them and visually lay out their album releases. The albums will be able to be clicked on to show information about the album and a tracklist.

\*A user of this website should be a able to use a search bar to input an artist and have the results show up on the page.

\*Once a user has selected an artist the website should display artist information likely in the form of a biography.

\*Once a user has selected an artist the website will also display the artists discography visually. When selecting an album the website will place that album in a larger detail, and probably show album details I.e. album title, year of release, etc.
